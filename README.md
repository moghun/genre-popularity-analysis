Zeitgeist of the 2020s will be the changes itself. Therefore, in order to keep track of and predict the "popular", analysing the trend and past trends is a must. 

This project is briefly an investigation of how the popularity of genres has changed over years and what sort of changes in the features of the musics bring about this alteration in the music trend.

As the data resourece of this project, we use the [Spotify Dataset 1921-2020 ](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data.csv) dataset.
